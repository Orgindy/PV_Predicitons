# PV Predictions

This repository contains a collection of scripts to process climate data and evaluate radiative cooling (RC) technologies combined with photovoltaic (PV) systems.

## Features
- ERA5 aggregation and preprocessing
- Clustering workflows for RC/PV potential
- Thermal modeling utilities
- Streamlit dashboard (`app.py`)

## Requirements
Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` before running any of the scripts or tests:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Tests
Unit tests use `pytest`. Ensure the dependencies are installed first, then run:

```bash
pytest -q
```
